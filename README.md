# Credit_Risk_Analysis

In this project, we use Python to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk. Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, I oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. With the given results, we can then evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk for future predictions.
